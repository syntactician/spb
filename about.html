<b>spb</b> encrypts and decrypts text on the internet. It can be used as a
<b>s</b>ecure <b>p</b>aste <b>b</b>in atop
<a href="//ptpb.pw/">ptpb.pw</a>
as a sort of secure layer into and out of pb. It is free and
<a href="//github.com/syntactician/spb">open source</a>;
use and adapt it however you want.

<b>spb</b> can be accessed by several URLs for stylistic reasons:
<a href="//sptpb.pw">sptpb.pw</a>,
<a href="//sleuthpaste.com">sleuthpaste</a>,
or
<a href="//paste.guvernator.net">paste.guvernator.net</a>.
We use
<a href="//sptpb.pw">sptpb.pw</a>
for examples in this document, but any of these URLs would work just the same.

        </p>

        <div class="section" id="contents">
          <h1>contents</h1>
          <div class="contents topic" id="id1">

            <ul class="simple">

spb can encrypt generic text contents
<a href="#method">with a password</a>
and post them to
<a href="//ptpb.pw/">ptpb.pw</a>.
Simply use the
<a href="//sptpb.pw/">form</a>
to enter text to encrypt and a desired password. The <b>created</b>
link at the top of the page will prompt for a password to decrypt the
contents. Give that link and the password to whoever needs to view
the content.

          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="decryption">
          <h1><a>decryption</a></h1>
          <p>

spb can decrypt any plain text on the web encrypted by
<a href="#method">our method</a>.
If there's some encrypted text at some URL
<tt class="docutils literal">xyz</tt>,
then:
<pre class="code literal-block">https://sptpb.pw/?<b>xyz</b></pre>
will show the decrypted contents of
<tt class="docutils literal">xyz</tt>
after prompting for a password. If
<tt class="docutils literal">xyz</tt>
is not a valid URL, we assume it refers to the ID of a paste on
<a href="//ptpb.pw/">ptpb.pw</a>, e.g.
<pre class="code literal-block">https://ptpb.pw/<b>xyz</b></pre>

        </div>
        <div class="section" id="method">
          <h1><a>method</a></h1>
          <p>

spb symmetrically encrypts/decrypts text with the CryptoJS AES functions, which
generate a 256-bit AES key from your password and some
<a href="//github.com/syntactician/spb/blob/master/assets/algo.js#L1">salt</a>
we provide.

We are also working on a command-line tool so that you may encrypt some plain
text, paste that text anywhere on the web, and decrypt by visiting:
<pre class="code literal-block">https://sptpb.pw/?<b>xyz</b></pre>
where
<tt class="docutils literal">xyz</tt>
is the URL of the text.

          </p>

        <div class="section" id="regarding-trust">
          <h1><a>regarding trust</a></h1>
          <p>

You don't need to trust us not to save your password somewhere. This site never
has access to your password, as it is stored locally. The site fetches the
cyphertext before you enter the password, so we can guarantee that neither the
plaintext nor the password are sent back to any server. Don't believe it? Try
this:

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="//sptpb.pw/?wcqg">this example encrypted paste</a>.</li>
<li>Once the page is loaded but before you type a password, disable internet access.</li>
<li>Enter the password&mdash;which is <b>truth</b>&mdash;and see that the text is decrypted.</li>
</ol>

"But that's not the issue!" you say. "What if your server is compromised and
some malicious code is sent instead?" That's a good point. If that's something
you're concerned about, just download
<a href="//github.com/syntactician/spb">the spb source</a>,
inspect it if you want, and visit index.html in a browser. This page will
function identically to sptpb.pw, as the entire site is just a static form
without dependencies. Obviously you need to have javascript enabled in your
browser.
